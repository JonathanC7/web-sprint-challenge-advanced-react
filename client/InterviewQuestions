Explain how to build stateful class components.
    You need to create a constructor pass super inside then create your this.state,
    giving it a value that you'd like to change later. 
    Whenever you'd like to change the state you can use this.setState

Describe the different phases of the component lifecycle.
    Mounting is the creation of the component. Update would be the life of your
    component and what happens throughout. Unmount is the death or end of the 
    component.

Demonstrate an understanding of class component lifecycle methods.
    componentDidMount refers to the component successfully mounting you can use 
    this to check if it mounts and if it does you can run a piece of code.
    The render method is pure and cannot handle state inside of, whatever you pass
    in it will give you the same result. In componentDidUpdate, once the updating 
    happens the method reacts and does what you plug inside of it. If you don't 
    have a conditional for this you might run into an infinite loop. componentWillUnmount
    this is called before the component is destroyed and is used for cleanup.

Define stateful logic.
    Stateful logic is any kind of logic that somehow interacts with a state of 
    something.

Describe how to test a React component with React Testing Library.
    You make a test.js version of it import the component into it then you begin 
    writing code that imitates a users actions so that you won't have to do it 
    yourself every single time and it will ultimately save you time.
